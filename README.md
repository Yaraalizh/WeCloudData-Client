# **Training Program Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**  
The training program analysis focuses on improving student outcomes by addressing challenges in enrollment, attendance, and completion. The project identifies trends, uncovers key insights, and provides actionable recommendations to enhance program effectiveness and retention rates. This effort leverages advanced data analytics to resolve data quality issues and guide decision-making.  

## **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to analyze a training program dataset to understand patterns in student performance and withdrawal rates. By utilizing **Python** for data cleaning and **Power BI** for visualization, the project delivers insights into attendance trends, level-specific challenges, and actionable strategies for improving outcomes.

## **Data Cleaning Process**  

### **Data Collection**  
The dataset included fields such as student status, attendance rates, withdrawal reasons, and level progression.  

### **Data Cleaning with Python**  
Utilized **Python (with Pandas)** for efficient data preparation, including:  
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensured data integrity by eliminating redundancy.  
- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed gaps through imputation and removal strategies.  
- **Standardization**: Reformatted fields like dates and statuses for consistency.  
- **Calculated Fields**: Created new metrics, such as completion and withdrawal percentages, to enrich the analysis.

## **Analysis of Training Program Visuals**  

1. **Student Status by Level**  
   - **Visualization**: A stacked bar chart showing student status (completed, failed, withdrawn) across levels.  
   - **Insights**: Identifies Level 1 as having the highest number of students, while Level 3 shows higher withdrawal rates, indicating advanced-level challenges.  

2. **Completion vs. Withdrawal Rates**  
   - **Visualization**: A pie chart comparing completion (79.28%) and withdrawal (20.72%) rates.  
   - **Insights**: Highlights strong attendance-completion correlation and the need for targeted retention strategies.  

3. **Attendance Impact on Outcomes**  
   - **Visualization**: A line chart correlating attendance percentages with completion rates.  
   - **Insights**: Students with attendance over 80% were most likely to complete, emphasizing the importance of consistent participation.  

4. **Peak Withdrawal Periods**  
   - **Visualization**: A timeline chart identifying periods with the highest withdrawal requests.  
   - **Insights**: Withdrawal peaks aligned with busy work periods and holidays, suggesting scheduling improvements could reduce dropouts.  

5. **Withdrawal Reasons Analysis**  
   - **Visualization**: A horizontal bar chart of reasons for withdrawal (e.g., workload, scheduling conflicts).  
   - **Insights**: Provides actionable insights to refine course requirements and support structures.

## **Conclusion**  
This analysis highlights critical trends in student performance, attendance, and retention. The findings offer actionable insights to improve program scheduling, guidance, and data collection processes, fostering better outcomes for students and stakeholders alike.
